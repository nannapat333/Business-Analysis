# Business-Analysis

## This project focuses on analyzing and improving the procurement process of one of the private construction company. The company operates across several management processes, including project management, cost control, and time management, ensuring that projects meet quality standards and are completed on time.

## The analysis identified key issues in the procurement process, including inefficient inventory tracking, poor communication between procurement teams and suppliers, and the lack of a centralized data system for real-time inventory management. These issues can lead to delays and cost overruns, which are critical in the construction industry. The project also highlights the importance of standardized operating procedures (SOPs), centralized data systems, and real-time tracking for improving procurement efficiency.

## As a solution, the project proposes a more streamlined procurement process, including the implementation of centralized software to better manage resources, improve communication, and ensure accurate procurement decisions. The goal is to enhance efficiency, reduce redundancies, and minimize over-ordering or under-ordering of materials, ensuring that projects stay within budget and are completed on schedule.
